title: Setting Up a Remote Scope

//TODO garbage broken code snippets. need a full rewrite

A remote scope is where the _shared_ release versions of components are stored. Each of these release versions packs in it the workspace configurations relevant to it, as well as artifacts produced by the ['build pipeline'](/building-with-bit/build-pipeline). That means, each component is not only available to be used in other repositories, but it can also be maintained and modified in other workspaces, as it offers all the information needed for it.

To explore popular use-cases of remote scopes, [see here](/essentials/what-is-bit#popular-use-cases).

Setting up a remote scope is done in two steps:

1. Create a scope on [Bit.dev](https://bit.dev) (or [self-host](/building-with-bit/scope/self-host-bit-scope) on your own server).

2. Configure your workspace to export components to one or more scopes

## Create a scope on Bit.dev

[Bit.dev](https://bit.dev) is a cloud service built by the maintainers of Bit. This cloud service offers a multitude of features necessary for collaborating on independent components. That includes hosting and organizing Bit scopes, great search capabilities, a [cross-repository CI for independent components](/essentials/what-is-bit#ripple-ci-coming-soon---component-driven-builds), and much more.

To create a new remote scope on [Bit.dev](https://bit.dev), [follow these steps](/building-with-bit/scopes).

## Configure remotes scopes in the workspace

As with (almost) any other type of workspace configuration, scopes can be set as the workspace default (for all components) or as a property of specific sets of components.

### Set a remote scope as the workspace default

The default scope is defined in the `workspace.jsonc` inside the `teambit.workspace/workspace` field. The default scope will be overridden by more [specific scope configurations](/building-with-bit/scopes#set-multiple-scopes-to-different-groups-of-components).

A scope hosted on Bit.dev will always have the following pattern: `<scope-owner>.<scope-name>`. A scope owner can be either a user or an organization.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://static.bit.dev/teambit/schemas/schema.json",
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "name": "my-workspace",
    "icon": "https://static.bit.dev/bit-logo.svg",
    "defaultScope": "my-org.my-scope"
  },
```

### Set multiple scopes to different groups of components

A single workspace can export components to multiple scopes. To achieve that, use [@teambit.workspace/variants](/building-with-bit/workspace) (in the `workspace.jsonc`)

```json
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
    // Select all components in the following directory
    "components/react/ui": {
        // Set the following scope
        "defaultScope": "my-org"."my-design-system"
    },
    // Select all components with the 'toolbox' namespace
        "{toolbox/*}": {
        // Set the following scope
        "defaultScope": "my-org"."my-toolbox"
    }
}
```

To learn more about using `@teambit.workspace/variants` to select components, [see here](/building-with-bit/workspace).

## Change component scope

In case you want to export a component to a different scope you will need to modify its configuration. This configuration operation changes the component module name, so you will have to run the `bit link` command. This command creates the new component module name in your project's `node_modules`.
