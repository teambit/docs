Bit enhances your development experience with a rich visual UI for components (i.e. "Workspace UI").  
This visual interface is how you can view and manage every part of your component development workflow in real time.

Through this UI you can can track the exact status of every component in your project at any given moment, in a visual way.  
While you develop your components, Bit's UI will provide an exact picture of every part of your components' development:
