title: Implement a Compiler
id: implement-compiler
---

Standard compilers like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) are integrated into Bit using a Bit Aspect. For example, the [Babel Aspect](https://bit.dev/teambit/compilation/babel) and the [TypeScript Aspect](https://bit.dev/teambit/typescript/typescript).
These Aspects implement the [Compiler's interface](https://bit.dev/teambit/compilation/compiler/~code/types.ts). A compiler implementation should be able to provide [compilation in the workspace](./workspace-compilation) as well as [compilation during build](./compiling-during-build).

The easiest way to start implementing a [Compiler](/compiler/overview) is to create a new Bit Aspect using the `Aspect` template:

```
bit create aspect extensions/my-compiler
```

As a convention, the compiler interface is implemented in a file named with the `compiler` prefix. Since it is a specific implementation file, it is not part of the generic Aspect component template and therefore needs to be created manually:

```bash title="Create an implementation file"
cd extensions/my-compiler
touch my-compiler.compiler.ts
```

The following methods, defined by the Compiler interface, map the standard compiler's properties and functionalities so that they can be used in a Bit context.

## Methods for compilation in the Workspace

:::tip
Workspace compilation should be configured for optimized dev experience, performance and debugging.
:::

The transpilation methods are used by the Compiler Service to transpile files in the workspace. Implement either the `transpileFile` method or the `transpileComponent` method.

- `transpileFile` - transpiles a single file, agnostic to the component's other files.
- `transpileComponent` - transpiles all the component's files. Use this when it's not possible to transpile files without their context (i.e, without having access to the component's other files).
  One example of this is the angular compiler (ng packager and ngcc) which requires the entire context, in order for it to perform.

### transpileFile

```jsx
transpileFile: (fileContent: string, options: { componentDir: string, filePath: string }) => Array<{ outputText: string, outputPath: string }> | null;
```

Gets a `fileContent` and returns the compiled content and the output path.

:::note
Whenever the compiler receives an unsupported file, it should return `null`.
:::

### transpileComponent

```jsx
transpileComponent: (params: { component: ConsumerComponent, componentDir: string, outputDir: string }) => Promise<void>;
```

Gets the component itself, the component dir (source dir) and the output dir (the component path in the `node_modules` directory).
The function should compile the files, and write them into the output folder.

:::note
The function should create a sub folder in the output dir to put the files inside.
:::

### displayConfig (optional)

```ts
displayConfig?(): string;
```

The `displayConfig` function helps the user to see the compiler config when using the `bit env <comp-id>` command.
It should return a string representation of the compiler config (for example JSON.stringify of the tsconfig file).

```
$ bit env ui/text

// ...
teambit.compilation/compiler

configured compiler: teambit.typescript/typescript (TypeScript @ 4.4.2)
compiler config:
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": [
      "es2019",
      "DOM",
      "ES6",
      "DOM.Iterable"
    ],
    "target": "es2015",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "jsx": "react",
    "declaration": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "exclude": [
    "dist"
  ]
}
```

## Methods for compilation during build

:::tip
When implementing the compilation during build you should optimize for runtime performance, consistency and reusability.
:::

### build

```js
build(context: BuildContext): Promise<BuiltTaskResult>;
```

- [`BuildContext`](https://bit.dev/teambit/pipelines/builder/~code/build-task.ts)<!-- TODO: maybe change link to point to the builder docs here-->
- [`BuiltTaskResult`](https://bit.dev/teambit/pipelines/builder/~code/build-task.ts)<!-- TODO: maybe change link to point to the builder docs here-->

Implements the logic of the compilation task. This method will be used by the Compiler Aspect to create a Build Task (that is, this method does not _directly_ create a new Build Task)

The build runs on a capsules network. <!--TODO add link -->
For each processed component, `ComponentResult` should be returned. <!--TODO add link -->
You should also return an array of [`ArtifactDefinition`](https://bit.dev/teambit/pipelines/builder/~code/artifact/artifact-definition.ts) <!-- TODO: maybe change link to point to the builder docs here-->.
The artifacts are the compiled files written into the capsules, or any other files created by the compiler (for example the ts compiler also generate `d.ts` files).

### distDir

```ts
distDir: string;
```

The relative path of the dist directory inside the capsule. e.g. "dist".

### distGlobPatterns (optional)

```ts
distGlobPatterns?: string[];
```

Determines which of the generated files are to be saved in the bit objects (when tagging a component).

e.g. distGlobPatterns = [`${this.distDir}/**`, `!${this.distDir}/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`];

See https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob for the supported glob patters syntax.

### artifactName (optional)

```ts
artifactName?: string;
```

Defaults to "dist".

Useful when the build pipeline has multiple compiler tasks of the same compiler. For instance, when using the same Babel compiler for two different tasks, one for creating "es5" files, and
the second for creating "esm". The artifact names would be "es5" and "esm" accordingly.

### createTask (optional)

An API to create a Compiler task via the concrete compiler implementation (instead of doing so via the Compiler Aspect)

```js
createTask?(name?: string): BuildTask;
```

### pre/post build (optional)

Runs before the build pipeline has started. This is useful when some preparations are needed to be done on all envs, before the build starts.

```js
preBuild?(context: BuildContext): Promise<void>;
```

Runs after the build pipeline completes (on all envs). Useful for "cleanups".

```js
postBuild?(context: BuildContext, tasksResults: TaskResultsList): Promise<void>;
```

## Shared methods and attributes

### name (optional)

```ts
name?: string;
```

The name of the compiler.

### shouldCopyNonSupportedFiles (optional)

```ts
shouldCopyNonSupportedFiles?: boolean;
```

Determines whether [unsupported files](#isFileSupported) (such as assets) should be copied into the dist directory.

### version

Returns the version of the current compiler instance (e.g. '4.0.1').
This represent for example the typescript or babel version.

```ts
version(): string;
```

### displayName

Returns the display name of the current compiler instance (e.g. 'TypeScript')

```js
displayName(): string;
```

### getDistPathBySrcPath

Given a source file, Return its compiled parallel in the dists. e.g. "index.ts" => "dist/index.js"
Both, the return path and the given path are relative paths.
For example, this is used to calculate the main dist file by the main file of the component.
It is also used to calculate different links Bit references to, when bundling the component.

```js
getDistPathBySrcPath(srcPath: string): string;
```

### isFileSupported

Only supported files matching get compiled. Others, are copied to the dist dir.

```js
isFileSupported(filePath: string): boolean;
```

## Methods for the main runtime file

The compiler implementation, the Bit Aspect, should offer a [main runtime](#) <!-- add link --> file, named `<compiler-name>.main.ts`.
This file should include the following methods:

### createCompiler

```ts
createCompiler() : Compiler
```

Creates an instance of a class that implements the [Compiler interface](https://bit.dev/teambit/compilation/compiler/~code/types.ts).

For example:

```js
createCompiler(options: BabelCompilerOptions, babelModule = babel): BabelCompiler {
    return new BabelCompiler(BabelAspect.id, this.logger, this.compiler, options, babelModule);
  }
```

### getPackageJsonProps

```ts
getPackageJsonProps(): PackageJsonProps
```

Updates the main dist file relative location, in every component's `package.json` file.

For example:

```js
getPackageJsonProps(): PackageJsonProps {
    return {
      main: 'dist/{main}.js',
    };
  }
```
