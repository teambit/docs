title: Compiler Overview
---

The Compiler aspect simplifies and standardizes the process of the compiling components.

Modern JS apps are usually compiled, using compilers like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), into standard formats that are compatible with browsers, bundlers (such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org)) and JS execution engines such as [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and [Deno](https://deno.land/).
Compilation standards include [ES2015](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/), [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html), [CommonsJS](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html) and others.

The role of the Compiler Aspect is to standardize this process across different components, by providing a simple and standard dev experience for compilation during development and build.

Compiled code is generated in the components' corresponding package (in development, this package can be found in the workspace `node_modules` directory). By default, the Compiler sets the `main` property of each component's `package.json` to `dist/{main}.js` (the component's main file, inside the `dist` directory).

```bash
├── node_modules
    ├── @my-org
        ├── ui.button
          ├── dist
              ├── index.js -> `package.json` points here if `index.js` is the main file.
              ├── index.js.map
              ├── button.js
              ├── button.js.map
          ├── ...
```

## Compiling for development

The Compiler Aspect standardizes compilation during development (in the Workspace) by providing the `bit compile` command, to compile all components, regardless of the specific compiler set by their corresponding Envs.

Compilation of components in the [Workspace](/workspace/overview) is configured to deliver a great dev experience by by optimizing performance and debugging.

This means Source Maps <!-- TODO [Source Maps](/) --> are generated and components are only transpiled (without types), into in the `node_modules` directory.

```bash
bit compile
```

Components can be watched for changes and recompiled with a single command as well.

```bash
bit watch
```

To learn more on compilation during development, please refer to [Workspace Compilation](/compiler/workspace-compilation).

## Compiling for distribution

Compiling components for distribution is done in a Capsule, as part of the [Build Pipeline](/builder/build-pipelines).

Component build can be simulated with `bit build` and done through [Tag](/components/tags) or [Snap](/components/snaps)

```bash
bit build
```

By default, Bit includes a [Build Task](/) for compiling components in the [Build Pipeline](/builder/build-pipelines) using the Compiler of your choice which is configured in the [Env](/envs/overview). Compilation for distribution is optimized for runtime performance, consistency and reusability. This means Source Maps <!--TODO [Source Maps](/)  -->are not being generated, target is preferred to be compatible with vast majority of browsers, bundlers and JS execution engines and Types are generated for the component, which can be costly in performance.

<!--TODO To learn more on compilation for distribution, please refer to [Compiling for distribution](/). -->

## Configuring and Implementing Compilers

Compilers are configured in the [Env](/envs/overview) which is configured on your [Component](/components/overview). Customizing the Compiler can be done by [customizing an existing env with your compiler](/compiler/configure-env) or by [implementing your own Env](/).
