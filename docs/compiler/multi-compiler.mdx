title: Multi compiler
---
The multi-compiler aspect allows the configuration of multiple compilers on a component. This determines which compiler to apply on a component file using the `isFileSupported()` <!--TODO add links to implement compiler --> compiler API.

- `createCompiler(compilers: Compiler[], options: CompilerOptions)` API to support the creation a Multi-compiler instance which can be used in the Env API (the `overrideCompiler` and `getCompiler` APIs).
- Supports the creation of a multi-compiler build tasks.

```ts
// create a multi compiler instance.
const compiler = multiCompiler.createCompiler([createBabelCompiler(), createTsCompiler()]);

// create a multi-compiler build task.
compiler.createTask('MultiCompiler', compiler);
```

## Special implementations details
### transpileFile
The `transpileFile` of the multi compiler is taking each one of the files and run it through the compilers.
Each compiler get's the output of the previous compiler in the list.
The check against isFileSupported are done against the previous compiler output path.
for example the ts compiler will compile the code, and change the output file path from `.ts` to `.js`, then the next compiler in the list
will check isFileSupported with the `.js` extension.
If a compiler in the list does not support a specific file, the file will be passed to the next compiler in the list, as is.

### build
As opposed to the transpile file, the build for all the compiler gets the same context as argument.
Which means, by default the compilers will be applied on the original source files, unless they know to read the outputs 
of the previous compiler from the capsules and use them as a base.
The build is running in serial (build of each compiler only starts after the build of previous one finished) this is to
be able to support reading the previous compiler output.

### pre/post build
The multi compiler will run all the pre/post build functions for any of the compilers that implement them.
This tasks will be run in parallel.

### getDistPathBySrcPath
The multi compiler will return the distPath returned by the first compiler that support a given file.
In case no compilers support a file, it will return `join(this.distDir, srcPath);`

### isFileSupported
The multi compiler return true if at least one of the compiler support the file.

### version
The multi compiler will return a string which contain the displayName@version for each one of the compilers, separated by new line.
For example
```
typescript@4.4.0
babel@7.11.6
```
