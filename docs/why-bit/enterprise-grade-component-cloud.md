## Enterprise-Grade Component Cloud

![component-discovery](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/Scope-bitdev.png)

Bit.dev is where teams and organizations build together with components. It’s your collaborative ecosystem to share components as a team and build applications together while keeping all components in perfect sync.

Enjoy a secured enterprise-grade cloud platform to easily scale development to multiple projects and teams, with a single hub to share, collaborate, and integrate components with each other.

### Secure enterprise-grade platform

Bit’s component platform is trusted by the best teams, who’s products you use every day.

It’s feature rich to meet the needs of global teams and enterprises, providing everything teams and organizations need to build and ship modern web projects together in a fast, scalable, and consistent way. The enterprise platform is highly secure to meet the most strict security and availability demands with 99% uptime SLA and advanced features like role-based permissions, SSO, and source-code encryption, and is certified SOC2.

### Share and discover everyone’s components

The component cloud is where teams expose and integrate components with each other.

Everyone can easily export and host all components in the cloud, with clear scoped ownerships. Every developer can search, filter, discover and integrate exactly the components they need to use. Advanced features like *component search* or *context filters* help you easily find the best components to fit your project’s context. All components and developers can connect and build modular web projects together through one collaborative hub.

### Enjoy beautiful documentations, always updated, no extra tools

As you code Bit helps you create beautiful API references, MDX, JSX or other documentation, and visually rendered examples for all your components. As you export components to the cloud, all of these become a fixed part of each component’s webpages, so you can instantly share it with everyone else on your team, organization, or the community.

As components are changed and updated, so will their documentation, and you need not maintain any extra tools or websites. More reuse, less overhead.

### Ripple CI - The world’s 1st cross-project modular CI (*Join Beta!*)

* **Build changes to all impacted components up the graph, across multiple projects**
* **Incrementally build changes to impacted components, nothing else, for x10+ performance**
* **Preview all changes with live rendering to help ensure design consistency and quality**
* **Build and test each impacted component individually to learn exactly what breaks and why**
* **Fast and fearless; No more fighting over master, no more waiting for bloated versions**

*Ripple CI* is continuous integration for the entire organization. It incrementally builds, tests, and even visually previews changes to components across all your applications simultaneously. This means you can release incremental changes to many teams and projects together.  
It builds and tests only impacted components, so you don’t have to build an entire application. The result is roughly 12x faster build times than the best CI tools we benchmarked. It also means that different people, or teams, can release changes at the same time without fighting over master, stepping on each other’s toes, or waiting for versions to bloat.  
Since all changes to all impacted components are *visualized in rendered previews*, designers and everyone else can take a hands-on part of the release process. No more breaking each other’s code, design, or experience ever again.

### Integrate to GitHub, Slack, and dozens of other tools

#### Automatically send updates as GitHub PRs to all impacted projects

Component changes that safely go through Ripple CI can be automatically turned into pull-request which are sent to all impacted projects. Each PR will contain the information from Ripple CI including all impacted components in the project, build and test results for each, and rendered preview to see the change visually. This integration makes it effortless to ensure that all relevant web projects will get and adopt the latest component versions.

#### Track components usage, adoption, and status

Track and learn exactly which components in which versions are used by which projects by which teams. Make sure every project is up to date with all the latest component versions. Learn which components fail or pass the latest tests in each project. Get valuable and relevant insights on the exact state of all your web projects, to ensure consistency and indulge your brand’s users at every touchpoint.

#### Connect Slack to send and get automated notifications

Integrate Slack to send and receive automated notifications on components you own or use, and make sure everyone will always be aware of relevant changes and the latest versions.

#### Use Webhooks to connect anything

Want to make sure that designers will review every component change? Use Webhooks to connect Bit.dev with Asana or any other tool to streamline and automate your workflow.

### Join the world’s largest OSS component community

Over 200,000 developers have joined the component community, creating thousands of open-source components shared with the developer community. Discover and share components with people around the world to build amazing things together.
