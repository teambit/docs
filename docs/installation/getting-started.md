## Welcome to Harmony!  

*Public Beta* :tada:

Harmony is Bit's next generation. It is a highly powerful and extensible infrastructure for developing modern applications in a modular way. Whether you are building a new project, or seeking to collaborate on components in your existing projects, Harmony will let you tap into the true power of components.   

Harmony is already used as a standard component infrastructure by many teams, including the world's finest. It is now available in public beta, so please feel free to start and please don't forget to [share your feedback](https://github.com/teambit/bit/issues)!  

### Get started

There are a few ways for you to get started with Harmony.  

#### [Take the Tutorial :feet:](https://harmony-docs.bit.dev/tutorial/install-bit)

- Take a hands-on approach with this step-by-step tutorial for building a modular React application with Bit components created in the workspace and imported from external projects. Learn how to install and set up a Bit workspace, add components, add life-full documentation and compositions, define isolated build and test environments, define and explore component dependencies in the workspace, version components and auto-update dependencies, import and export components to remote scopes to be shared across many projects, and more.  

#### [Explore the demo project :crystal_ball:](https://harmony-docs.bit.dev/introduction/try-bit)

- Get a fully functional Bit workspace with independent components developed and managed by Bit, in this project and imported from other projects, where you can explore and experiment with every part of the Bit workspace, development UI, change and manage components, and learn how it works.  

#### Watch Video Guides :tv:  (**Coming soon!**)

- Start with step-by-step video guides to walk you through every step from creating a component to building a full-blown micro-applications architecture that scales and accelerates development, delivery, and innovation. Coming soon!
