title: Package Managers
---

Bit's Package Manager Aspect encapsulates Yarn, pnpm, NPM or any other supported CommonJS package manager using the `bit install` command.

For package managers to work properly, Bit uses Workspace features such as [Yarn Workspaces](/) or [NPM Workspaces](/) that allow the installation of independent components with conflicting dependencies on the same [Workspace](workspace/overview).

Package Managers such as Yarn, pnpm and NPM In Bit are responsible for `node_modules` installation. Bit works with any of them, making sure to interact with their latest APIs, deduping component dependencies properly prior to `node_modules` installation.

## Deduping of dependencies

Bit handles depuping of component dependencies in the [Workspace](/workspace/overview). This means every component can be resolved with a different version of a specific package in case of conflicts in Component versions between different Workspace Components.

## Yarn

Bit supports Yarn 2.0, and uses Yarn Workspaces to make sure proper deduping between components.

## pnpm

:::caution Do not use pnpm with React Native
pnpm cannot be used with the React Native environment.
:::

:::note pnpm's deduping algorithm
The pnpm aspect uses Bit's deduping algorithm (not pnpm's).
It searches for a common version that satisfies most components using the same dependency (taking into consideration permitted version ranges configured for each component) and installs it at the workspace root directory, where it can be shared by multiple dependent components.
Versions that are used by a minority of components will be installed nested in each component directory.
