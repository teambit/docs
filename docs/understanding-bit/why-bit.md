# Why Bit?

Modern app development is component-driven.

Yet while we use component-driven technologies, we still develop and deploy each application as a single monolith.
This is because Up until now the tool-chain we've been using to build software - versioning, building, deploying - was created for projects, not components.

The components inside each project - UI, logic, and even backend - are all internal and serve only this one application, thus canceling the exponential value of modularity.

Think what if we could "free" our components, turning them into decoupled and composable Lego pieces, that we can independently version and easily use in many projects.

And when different teams wish to collaborate on the same app, while each team works on different components, they are forced to scrumble and stumble on each other in a cumbersome monolith, bound to each other in codebase, versions, and releases.

But what if we could unleash the true power of components?

To build independent components that we can use anywhere, and then use them to compose modular applications like Lego?  
To free developers - and teams - to build and deploy components and not apps? And to freely share and collaborate with each other?

This simple paradigm shift makes development much faster, more scalable, consistent, and collaborative. It's a better way to build software.

This is Bit.

## Benefits of Bit

Bit unlocks the benefits of _modular software development_, at every step of your application development and release cycle.

Instead of building monoliths, Bit lets you break down the development process into decoupled components. Developing large systems out of smaller well-decoupled components is much simpler and quicker.
Bit helps then you compose your components into applications which are highly modular, maintainable, consistent, and scalable.

It enables teams to build and deliver autonomously, while collaborating with other teams via components to speed up and standardize development.

## Software Development with Bit

### Faster Development

Bit _speeds up_ the development of component-driven applications by making it quick and simple to reuse (and even edit) any component that already exists in your codebase.
All existing components are hosted in Scopes and can be easily discovered and used to accelerate the development of new applications.
Furthermore, Bit provides reusable and highly customizable templates for developing, building, and testing components - so you don't have to waste time on anything but your app.

In addition to making reuse quick and easy, Bit accelerates app development by decoupling the development of components from each other. So that instead of (monolith)...

### Autonomous Teams

With Bit an application is just a composition of components. Instead of having many developers struggle to develop features while all working in the same codebase and with the same release pipelines.

Bit lets you develop components in simple decoupled codebases, while every component is independently versioned and integrated into the larger application (or applications).

As a result, different teams can autonomously develop, build, and deploy features and upgrades to production - working only with and on what they build.

This means smaller and more frequent releases by autonomous product teams, who are quickly able to respond and deliver to user needs.

### Cross-Team Collaboration

When many teams build multiple apps, it becomes critical for them to collaborate and share components with each other to develop faster and more consistently.

With Bit you can almost instantly use any component in any application, making it easy to organize and share components between teams.

As every component is versioned, you can continuously release and get updates from other teams via CI/CD, and stay in sync.
Advanced features such as Bit Import (quick local forking), Lanes (make "pull-requests" to multiple components and their dependencies across projects), and Snaps (propose un-versioned changes) make it easy to collaborate and create a discussion.

### Consistency (Standardization)

With every new developer and project it becomes harder to keep consistency in our development and release process.

Bit is a powerful tool for standardizing the development of components at scale:

- A) Bit makes it very easy to share existing components and use them across teams and applications.
- B) With Bit, it becomes simple for the organization to standardize how components should be developed and to provide each and every team with customizable templates for components and for component development environments.

Bit lets you create and customize your component dev and build environments, so that you can easily reuse and share the way you develop and build components.

An organization can use these features to create standard templates for component development, that all teams will use and deliver the same way.

## Scaling development

### More Releases

with Bit you version and release independent components.
This means product teams become _free to deliver_ fast and autonomously to production.

In short, this means:

- A) You can update, hotfix, or rollback an atomic part of your application.
- B) You can release changes without fighting over main (aka "master") branch.
- C) You can split the release pipeline of different teams working on the same project.

As a result, developers can release small focused changes many times a day - and don't have to wait long for bloated versions of the entire project.

With Bit Cloud and Ripple CI, you can propagate these changes to all projects and teams using the updated components, building all impacted components up the dependency graph of the entire organization.

## Software with Bit

With Bit you can leverage the advantages of modularity to improve not only the development process but also the final product- software itself.

### Decoupled

When you build with Bit you break down larger systems into decoupled components and can improve on each of them autonomously.

### Easy to understand

It's much easier to dive into a small well defined codebase of a component than into the gigantic codebase of an entire monolith.

### Visible

When you break sofware into components with Bit it becomes much easier and quicker to learn which components you have and what they do.

### Maintainable

When every component is versioned and isolated from the rest of the system you can more easily fix, replace, or remove any part of the system.

### Resilient

Modular software is much more resilient as specific components can be compromised without compromising the entire system.

### Testable

It is much easier to test components than to test a large system. Bit creates exponential value for testing components as each component is tested in 100% isolation outside of your project and you can leverage these tests to validate changes to safely update components and dependencies, across projects.

### Super Scalable

Component-driven software with Bit is much easier to scale. You have complete visibility and control over your technology and can easily add new components or change existing ones across many projects. Your entire codebase is a graph of smaller components, like natures largest and most sustainable systems.
