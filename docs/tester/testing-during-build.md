title: Testing During Build
---

Testing components for distribution is done during `build` by the Bit [Builder](/builder/overview).

Component build can be simulated with `bit build` and done through [Tag](/components/tags) or [Snap](/components/snaps)

```bash
bit build
```

By default, Bit's pre-configured Envs includes a [Build Task](/builder/overview#build-task) for testing components in the [Build Pipeline](/builder/build-pipelines), each using the Env's specific test configs.

Testing during build provides the highest "external validity" by running tests on the distributable code that was generated by the Env's compiler and not by the tester's.
That way, the exact same code that will be consumed by other components, is tested before it is released. Moreover, since each component is tested in a capsule <!--TODO [capsule](#) -->, isolated from the rest of the workspace, tests are guaranteed to provide results that are context-agnostic and free of false-positives.
