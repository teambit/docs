A scope is where the release versions of Bit components are stored. [Remote scopes](/scope/overview#remote-scope), either on [Bit.dev](https://bit.dev) or other self-hosted Bit servers, store exported components that are available to be used by other web projects.
A single server may host multiple scopes. Each of these scopes groups together components that are related to each other by function or purpose. Each scope naturally corresponds to a specific team of developers (and even non-developers).

You can host a Scope on your own server, or use the bit.dev platform (free for OSS and limited private usage). On top of hosting components, Bit.dev offers useful features for discoverability, documentation, collaboration, component registry, team management, security and more.
