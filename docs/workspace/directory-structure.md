title: Directory Structure
id: directory-structure

The Bit [Workspace](workspace/overview) is flexible in directory structure to preserve a seamless dev experience for building distributed apps. It is flexible for teams to decide how they prefer to structure their [Workspace](workspace/overview).  

Components can be tracked in any directory in the project's file system with the `bit add` command.

```bash
bit add path/to/dir/button
```

The default directory structure for a Bit Workspace is defined in [workspace.json](workspace/workspace-json). The default directory structure is as a pattern used by commands placing Components in the Workspace like `bit create` or `bit import`.

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "defaultDirectory": "{scope}/{name}",
  }
}
```

Other available params for the pattern are: `{namespaces}` and `{componentName}`.

By default, we configure `Scope` to be the top level directory to preserve team boundaries and ownership on Components in the Workspace. 

```bash
├── base-ui --> `Scope` used to define team boundaries and ownership
    ├── ui --> `Component Namespaces` to assist with organization and configuration of componentsused
        ├── button --> `Component Directory` includes a specific Component implantation
