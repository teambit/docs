*Public Beta* :tada:

<!-- Harmony is Bit's next generation. It is a highly powerful and extensible infrastructure for developing modern applications in a modular way. Whether you are building a new project, or seeking to collaborate on components in your existing projects, Harmony will let you tap into the true power of components.

Harmony is already used as a standard component infrastructure by many teams, including the world's finest. It is now available in public beta, so please feel free to start and please don't forget to [share your feedback](https://github.com/teambit/bit/issues)!  -->

## What does Open Beta even mean

Bit v15 (harmony) is the platform used to build both the UI, backend and middleware of Bit and bit.dev . It is used by different development teams across the world for several months and is used to build production systems.
We decided to name v15 as open beta because there are still major features coming, and until they released we don't feel v15 is complete. Right now not all teams can transition to v15, as support for Angular and Vue is not available.

If you are building any React/React-native and NodeJS base systems, we urge you to get started with v15 as we believe it provides a far better developer experience.

### Get started

There are a few ways for you to get started with Harmony.

#### [Follow our Get Started Guide](/getting-started/installing-bit)

Want to get started quickly and see how Bit works? This quick guide will take you through installing Bit, initializing a workspace, creating a component, tagging a component, seeing your component in the local workspace, creating a remote scope, configuring your workspace, exporting your component and installing your component in an external app.

#### [Understand how to Build with Bit](/building-with-bit/workspaces)

Take a deep dive in to the core of how Bit works and see how you can not just build with Bit but also extend Bit. In this section we cover everything from Component Compositions to Testing as well as Environments, Compiling and Build Pipelines and more.

<!-- #### [Take the Tutorial :feet:](/tutorial/install-bit)

- Take a hands-on approach with this step-by-step tutorial for building a modular React application with Bit components created in the workspace and imported from external projects. Learn how to install and set up a Bit workspace, add components, add life-full documentation and compositions, define isolated build and test environments, define and explore component dependencies in the workspace, version components and auto-update dependencies, import and export components to remote scopes to be shared across many projects, and more.  

#### [Explore the demo project :crystal_ball:](/demo/try-bit)

- Get a fully functional Bit workspace with independent components developed and managed by Bit, in this project and imported from other projects, where you can explore and experiment with every part of the Bit workspace, development UI, change and manage components, and learn how it works.   -->

<!-- #### Watch Video Guides :tv:  (**Coming soon!**)

- Start with step-by-step video guides to walk you through every step from creating a component to building a full-blown micro-applications architecture that scales and accelerates development, delivery, and innovation. Coming soon!   -->
