[Bit](/essentials/what-is-bit) is an [open-source toolchain](https://github.com/teambit/bit) for composing modern applications from independent components. In the Bit world, we build components not apps. The only thing our workspace contains are components, and the app is just another component. Each component can be a composition of many other components that eventually compose the entire app, that is essentially one big component. In Bit we never have a project, we never have an application, as having an application is against the nature of Component Driven Architecture.

Instead of building an application that consists of lots of components, we build lots of components that are composed to build many different applications. This is another way of thinking. The application is just a deployment therefore it has no meaning. It's just a composition of everything that is deployed to somewhere. Building with Bit helps you build more modular, maintainable, testable, and reusable code.

[Bit Cloud](https://bit.dev/) is a cloud hosting service for components. It provides developers and teams with an end-to-end solution for hosting, organizing, discovering, consuming, updating, and collaborating on components. It is possible to use Bit with or without Bit Cloud.

### Think more in components and less in apps

Bit is not only a more efficient way of doing things, it's a **revolutionary** way of doing it. It's a totaly new mindset.
When you think only about efficienty, you keep on building more applications trying to improve the process of working and building these applications in the existing tool chain - in the existing manner. But If you are thinking wrong way - if you are thinking in apps and not in components - then your core assemptions are wrong.

We can help you solve this mental model. Bit works on the component model. If each of your components are individual you can build micro frontends with just the component model. With Bit we want you to think in components, to think in a more modular way, to think differently about how you start to build new features. Think more in components and less in apps.

### Use Bit if you want to:

- Build a component eco system.
- Create a better collaboration workflow around your components.
- Publish individual components, and scale the amount of components you are publishing.
- Organize components, consume components with a great development experience.
- Standardize the way to build components.
- Organize components in a central place which allows you to easily onboard new people with discoverability of components.
- Integrate different components.
- Easily manage dependencies of a variety of components.

Bit makes the process of building modular applications and the development, publishing and management of independent components really easy. It focuses on the publishing process of components whereas the consumption of components is handled by package managers such as npm or yarn.

## Get started

Workshop on Getting started with Bit, Composing components, Exporting components and Consuming components in a React application.

### Bit v15 - Harmony

**Harmony** introduces major improvements to Bit and how developers should build their components. At the moment it supports **React**, **React Native** and **NodeJS**. For teams using **Angular** or **Vue**, it is recommended to get started with Bit's v14 release [here](https://docs.bit.dev).

#### Public Beta

Bit v15 **Harmony** is used by many teams and is the underlying infrastructure for Bit and [bit.dev](https://bit.dev). We decided to tag it as an **open beta** as there are still major features coming. If you are building any React/React-native and NodeJS based systems, we urge you to get started with v15.

## Additional Resources and Support

- [Start a discussion or suggest a feature or a fix on GitHub :wrench:](https://github.com/teambit/bit/issues)
- Find more [resources](resources/conference-talks) and learn about Bit some more.

## Host Components on [bit.dev](https://bit.dev)

While Bit is a 100% open source platform where you can create your own Bit-server, [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) is a cloud service provided by Bit, where you can quickly set an account and publish your components. [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) is free for open source components and projects.
