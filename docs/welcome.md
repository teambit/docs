Bit is a platform for building with components and use them to compose apps and systems. Building with Bit gives a host of benefits for our codebase's modularity, composability, testability, and scalability.

## Get started

* To get started follow [this guide](/getting-started/installing-bit) 
* Read [next steps](getting-started/whats-next) to start learning how you can adopt and use Bit for building apps and systems.
* Learn [what is Bit](essentials/what-is-bit) to have a better understanding of its capabilities.

### Bit v15 - Harmony

**Harmony** introduces major improvements to Bit and how developers should build their components. At the moment it supports **React**, **React Native** and **NodeJS**. For teams using **Angular** or **Vue**, it is recommended to get started with Bit's v14 release [here](https://doce.bit.dev).

#### Public Beta

Bit v15 **Harmony** is used by many teams and is the underline infrastructure for Bit and [bit.dev](https://bit.dev). We decided to tag it as an **open beta** as there are still major features coming. If you are building any React/React-native and NodeJS based systems, we urge you to get started with v15.

## Host Components on [bit.dev](https://bit.dev)

While Bit is a 100% open source platform where you can create your own Bit-server, [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) is a cloud service provided by Bit where you can quickly set an account to publish your components. [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) is free for open source components and projects.
