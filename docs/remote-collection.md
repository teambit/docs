title: Creating a Remote Collection
---

A Remote Collection is a curated and dynamic list of shared components on a remote server. Use collection for collaborating on components between repositories.

You can create a Collection for specific projects, ideas, teams and more. Components in remote collections are discoverable by other developers.

## Creating a remote Collection on [bit.dev](https://bit.dev/)

Once signed-in, click on the ’+ ADD PROJECTS’ button in the top-right corner of the screen. Choose ‘Create Collection’ from the menu. In the ‘Create Collection’ page, enter the following information:

* Collection name
* Visibility - Determines who can view the Collection:
  * Public - A free Collection that is visible and searchable by the [bit.dev](https://bit.dev/)  community. [bit.dev](https://bit.dev/) offers free hosting for public open source Collections, now and forever.
  * Private - A closed Collection. You choose who has access permissions to the collection.
* License - Code license for all the Collection’s contents.

Click on ‘Create Collection’. Bit redirects you to the new Collection.

## Collection role types

There are 3 role types in a [bit.dev](https://bit.dev/) Collection:

* Admin - a collection admin has root access. Including the ability to set permissions and manage the Collection memberships.
* Developer - a developer can contribute, view and discover the Collection’s components. A developer can’t invite new members.
* Viewer - a viewer can view and use the Collection’s components. A viewer can’t contribute to the Collection.

### Collection license

The components in a Collection share the same license. These are the available license types:

* None
* GPL- 3.0
* MIT
* Apache-2.0
* BSD (1,2,3)

### Update Collection settings

To update a Collection's settings, click on 'Settings' in the Collection page.

#### Update visibility

Changing a Collection’s visibility affects all the components within that Collection. Thus affects other developers that use components in that collection.

#### Add members

A Collection admin can add an unlimited amount of signed-up users as members.

To add a member:

1. In the 'Settings' page, click on 'Permissions'.
2. Type either the username or email address of the member you wish to add under 'Add a member', and choose a role.
3. Click on 'Add'.

#### Remove members

To remove a member:

1. In the 'Settings' page, click on 'Permissions'.
2. Find the user you'd like to remove in the members list.
3. Click on the trash icon to the right.

Note: removing people might hurt their feelings :)
