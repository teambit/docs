A Bit workspace enables a single repository to [author](/getting-started/add-components), [export](/getting-started/export-to-scope), [import](/getting-started/import-install-components) and [manage](/getting-started/manage-dependencies) multiple independent components.

## Initialize a new workspace

(Run the following command in the root directory of your project)

```shell
bit init --harmony
```

:::info Initializing a Bit workspace in an existing project
A Bit workspace can be initialized on an empty directory, to create a new modular project from scratch.
It can also be initialized on an existing project to modularize it and export its components to a remote scope.
:::

:::info the --harmony option
The `--harmony` option creates a Bit Harmony workspace. Omitting it will create Bit's legacy workspace.
Harmony components and Bit legacy components cannot switch workspace.
:::

## Reset a Bit workspace

```shell
bit init --reset-hard
```

## The anatomy of a workspace

1. [**Workspace configurations**](/workspace/configurations) (the `workspace.jsonc` file).
   This is where rules and policies are set for the workspace itself but also for each component managed by it.
   These rules include component dependencies, development environments, default scopes, and so on.

2. **Files-to-component mapping** (the `.bitmap` file). This is where Bit maps multiple files to single units, components. This process happens once a component is tracked by Bit (`bit add path/to/component`). This mapping will also include the following information:

   - The component entry point (usually, the `index.js/ts` file).
   - The component version (if a component has been versioned).
   - Whether this component is [pending to be versioned](/components/versioning#soft-and-hard-tags-component-collaboration) by the CI.

   ```json title="An example .bitmap file"
   {
     "org.extensions/environments/custom-react@0.0.9": {
       "mainFile": "index.ts",
       "rootDir": "cet/environments/dell-react"
     },
     "org.design/base-ui/search-box-with-button@0.0.5": {
       "mainFile": "index.ts",
       "rootDir": "design/base-ui/searchBoxWithButton",
       "exported" false,
       "nextVersion": {
           "version": "0.0.7",
           "message": "add debouncing",
           "username": "John",
           "email": "john@my-mail.com"
       }
     },
     "version": "14.8.9-dev.298"
   }
   ```

3. [**Local scope**](/scope/overview#local-scope) (the `.bit` or `.git/.bit` directory). This is where versioned or tagged components (either authored or imported) are stored.

4. **Component packages** (located in the `node_modules/@scope-name` directory). This is where the distributable, compiled, code of a component is placed. Components in the workspace refer to each other only via their packages. This is crucial to keeping each component independent and context-agnostic.

5. **Workspace UI**. The workspace UI is a visual real-time representation of the workspace.
   Components managed by the workspace can be views as they are rendered in isolation.
   In addition to that, different aspects of a component, such as its history, documentation and even test logs, can be explored to get a better understanding of it and assist in developing it as and independent building block.

## Run the workspace UI / development server

Se the Workspace UI at https://localhost:3000

```shell
bit start
```

## Get the most out of a Bit Workspace

While components can be added and managed by a Workspace on an ad-hoc basis, we envisage workspaces as the interface between your code repo and the Bit eco-system. By creating a Bit workspace at the root of your repo file system for instance, you can then manage each component as a separate module - with it's own versioning, build and CI, and much more; all the while keeping the existing file structure of your repo or mono repo (Bit is entirely agnostic to how you organise and track your code). That way Bit works seamlessly with your source control, while providing entirely isolated control over the individual components the repo contains.

Bit Workspaces are focused on composing applications with components. We recommend breaking down your frontend application to its most basic building blocks (buttons, text inputs, etc) and then successively composing pages, data-flows, forms, and applications using your components and APIs they expose. Components can be implemented in React, Angular, Vue, Stencil, and Node.

## Bit workspace and Git

Make sure to track the following files with your SCM:

- `.bitmap`
- `worksapce.jsonc`

> You should not track the local scope (`.bit` or `.git/bit`) with Git.
