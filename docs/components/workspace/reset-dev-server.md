title: Reset the Dev Server
---

Any change in the `workspace.jsonc` file requires a restart of the local dev-server. We can stop our server using (Ctl/cmd + c) and run it again using the start command.

```bash
bit start
```

:::tip

Use `bit start --help` or `bit start -h` to get a list of available options for this command.
