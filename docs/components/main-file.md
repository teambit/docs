title: Main File

Main file of the Component is the file resolved upon a `require` of the Component Directory. Main file is usually expected to expose the Component API.
It is set upon tacking or creation of a Component using and defined in the `.bitmap` file. 

## index files

By default, an `index.ts` or an `index.js` file is considered to be the main file of a [Component](/components/overview). 
It is recommended to expose all APIs expected to be used by the [Component](/components/overview) consumers from the Component main file. Here is an example for a simple `index.ts` file of a `Button` component.

```ts
export { Button } from './button';
export type { ButtonProps }  from './button';
```

### Requiring internal files of components
Requiring internal files of components is highly not recommended and might cause inconsistencies due to compiling of the Component. If requiring an internal file makes sure to only `require` files which are not compiled by the [Component](/components/overview) defined [Compiler](/compiler/overview).

```ts
import { Button } from '@teambit/base-ui.button'; // good!
import { Button } from '@teambit/base-ui.button/button'; // bad!
import styles from '@teambit/base-ui.button/button.modules.scss'; // resources like `scss` and `png` which are expected static files handled by the bundler.
import img from 
```

## Main file resolution
By default, Bit resolves `index.ts` or `index.js` to be the main file of the Component if one of them exists. Otherwise, Bit looks for a file corresponding to the [Component Name](/components/component-id#component-name). In a case a main file is defined through the `--main` flag, Bit will look for this file alone.

## Changing a Component main file
Changing a main file can be achieved by the `bit add` command. Use `bit add` on the desired [Component ID](/components/id) and use the `--main` flag to define the new main file.

```bash
$ bit add ui/button --main button.ts
```
