title: Create a Bit.dev Account
---

By default, Bit is connected to [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) as its default hosting provider. Run the `bit login` command for Bit to open a login/sign-up form for a new personal account.

```bash
bit login
```

Once an account has been created successfully, your terminal will greet you with the following message:

```bash
successfully added @bit as a scoped registry at /Users/<account>/.npmrc
success! logged in as <account name>
```
