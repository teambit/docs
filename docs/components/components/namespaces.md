title: Namespaces

Namespaces serve as (abstract) folders that organize components in the Workspace/Remote Scope. In addition to that, namespaces are a way to decouple your components' configurations from the file structure, as they allow you to handle components using names that pertain to the function and purpose of a component.

To namespace a component us the `--namespace` or `-n` option.
