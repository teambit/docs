Namespaces serve as folders that organize components in the Workspace or inside a collection on bit.dev. You can use namespaces inside a collection to group related components.

To namespace a component us the `--namespace` or `-n` option.

Specifying a namespace helps you you organize your components and lets you perform actions on multiple components at once. Namespaces are also useful in specifying overriding rules for all components under a specific namespace.
