After adding a component the `.bitmap` file will be regenerated to show the added component. For now the scope and version will be empty.

```json
/* THIS IS A BIT-AUTO-GENERATED FILE. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY. */

{
  "ui/button": {
    "scope": "",
    "version": "",
    "mainFile": "index.ts",
    "rootDir": "button"
  },
  "version": "1.0.39"
}
```
