After adding a component the `.bitmap` file will be regenerated to show the added component. For now the scope and version will be empty. Below is an example of button component created with the ui namespace.

```json
/* THIS IS A BIT-AUTO-GENERATED FILE. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY. */

{
  "ui/button": {
    "scope": "",
    "version": "",
    "mainFile": "index.ts",
    "rootDir": "my-scope/ui/button"
  },
  "version": "1.0.39"
}
```

:::note my-scope
Components are created under the default scope name which in this case is `my-scope`. You can configure the default scope name in the `workspace.jsonc` file.
