Use the `bit create` command to create generic components.

```bash
bit create react-component ui/my-card
```

is the same as

```bash
bit create react-component my-card --namespace ui
```

Create multiple components by adding more component names after the command.

```bash
bit create react-component ui/component1 ui/component2 design/component1
```
