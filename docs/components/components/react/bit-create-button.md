We can use `bit create` to create an example button component with the namespace of `ui`. This will also create a package in your workspace `node_modules` directory and add your component to the workspace UI.

```bash
bit create react-button ui/button
```

is the same as

```bash
bit create react-button button --namespace ui
```
