title: Linting During Build
---
By default, linting is **not** part of the [Build Pipeline](/builder/build-pipelines).

During build, the lint task is only used for checking linting issues. it will not re-write the components with the auto fix option.
In case you want to use the auto fix option for your components, you should use the `bit lint --fix` command on your workspace.

## Adding a linter task to your build pipeline

To add your lint task to your build pipeline you need to add its task into the build pipeline using the `getBuildPipe` of your env:
(built in envs come with an API to only add new tasks to their existing pipe)<!-- TODO: add link here -->

```ts
  getBuildPipe(modifiers: GetBuildPipeModifiers = {}): BuildTask[] {
    return [...someTasks, linterTask];
  }
```

To implement your own linter, [see here](#).<!-- TODO: add link here -->
