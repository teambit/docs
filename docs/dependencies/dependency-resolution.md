title: Dependency Resolution

Bit's dependency resolution favours consistency and predictability, making sure each time a component is installed 

Component dependencies are resolved and determined during component versioning. Depen 

Depndencies

```bash
bit tag --all
```

Dependency resolution is handled by the [Dependency Resolver extension](https://bit.dev/teambit/dependencies/dependency-resolver).

Dependency Resolver parses out all `import` \ `require` statements in the component's files.
It then determines if these dependencies are packages, components (listed in the workspace `.bitmap` file) or internal implementation files.
The generated data is integrated with dependency policies that were set by various Bit extensions (mainly,
Environment) and by the manually configured policies set in the workspace configuration file (`workspace.jsonc`).

The result of that process determines the list of dependencies for each component, as well as their dependency-type (`dependencies`, `devDependencies` and `peerDependencies`) and version number.

## The dependency policies hierarchy

The Dependency Resolver integrates dependency policies from various sources to determine the component's final dependency graph.
Cases of conflicting policies are resolved according to a hierarchy of source types, where the one at the top overrides the rest.

The hierarchy in a descending order:

1. Policies set by Variants (@teambit/variants) and the component.json files of "ejected" components (these two sources are merged by Variants).
2. Policies set by various extensions/aspects (using registerDependencyPolicy)
3. Policies set by the environment (using getDependencies)
4. Bit’s automated dependency detections, and policies set by the Dependency Resolver at the workspace configuration root-level.

:::info understanding the resolved dependencies for a component
Use the `bit dependencies <component-id>` command to understand the calculations and interactions that resolved in the generated dependency graph of a specific component.
