Component operations are made simplified and standard with [Envs](/envs/overview) and or more specifically through [Env Services](/envs/services/overview). [Env Services](/envs/services/overview) allowing the creation of a [Service](/envs/services/overview) which is meant to make a certain a development operation simplified and standard across all components. Examples to services in Bit are: [Compiler](/compiler/overview), [Tester](/tester/overview), [Builder](/builder/overview), [Linter](/linter/overview), Bundler <!--TODO [Bundler](/bundler/overview) -->. Services are implemented by tool-specific Aspects like [TypeScript](/typescript/overview) or [Jest](/jest/overview) and used from [Env](/envs/env) like [React](/react/overview) or [Node](/node/overview), composing them together to form an entire development experience to a certain type of a component. This makes the development of every component simple and standard for all developers regardless to the specific tools used.

Below chart is demonstrating how a `bit compile` command flows in Bit until invokes the right `TypeScript` compiler which is defined in the component's configured Env.

## Compiling

Your Workspace might include components that are using different Envs which are defined to use different Compilers and compiler configurations. While the React Env apply [TypeScript](/aspects/typescript) as a Compiler on some of the components in your Workspace, others might be configured with the [Node Env](/aspects/node) which is defined to use [Babel](/aspects/babel) or even TypeScript but with a different `tsconfig.json`.
Bit leaves you agnostic to this complexity and allows to use a single simplified command to compile all components in your workspace, regardless to the specific Compiler configured to them.

```bash
bit compile
```

```bash
  STATUS	COMPONENT ID
✔ SUCCESS	templates/envs/my-react --> Using the Aspect env which is set to use the `Babel` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS	templates/pages/welcome --> Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS	templates/ui/card --> Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS	templates/ui/heading --> Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS	templates/ui/text --> Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS	ui/my-welcome --> Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.

✔ 6/6 components compiled successfully.
Finished. (3s)
```

Different Envs might use different `tsconfig.json` or `.babelrc.js`.

`bit watch` does the same while re-compiling on every component change.

```bash
bit watch
```

Same Compiler is also applied in the Component's build pipeline, to make sure your component compiles correctly for distribution.
To learn more on Compiler, head to over to the [Compiler documentation](/compiler/overview).

## Testing

Same is applied on Testing. In this case, all components are configured to use an [Env](/envs/overview) which uses Jest <!--TODO [Jest](/jest/overview) --> but with two different configuration, one for Aspects and other for React components.

```bash
bit test
```

```bash
testing total of 6 components in workspace 'my-workspace'
testing 5 components with environment company.scope/templates/envs/my-react

 PASS  ui/my-welcome/my-welcome.spec.tsx
 PASS  templates/pages/welcome/welcome.spec.tsx
 PASS  templates/ui/text/text.spec.tsx
 PASS  templates/ui/card/card.spec.tsx
 PASS  templates/ui/heading/heading.spec.tsx

Test Suites: 5 passed, 5 total
Tests:       18 passed, 18 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        2.815 s, estimated 3 s
Ran all test suites.
tested 6 components in 4.194 seconds.
```

The [Tester](/tester/overview) is also adding a UI that provides a single and standard UI for exploring and learning tests regardless to the specific tools used to test the components.

To learn more about the Tester and component Testing, head over to the [Tester documentation](/tester/overview).

## Building

[Builder](/builder/overview) service makes the process of building components simple, standard and blazing fast. Each [Env](/envs/overview) can define its [Build Pipeline](/builder/build-pipelines) and compose tasks implemented by other [Env Services](/envs/services/overview) such as [Compiler](/compiler/overview) or [Tester](/tester/overview).

```bash
bit build
```

<Image src={builderImg} width="100%" />

To learn about building components and the Builder, head over to the [Builder documentation](/builder/overview) section.

## Linting

By default, [React Env](/aspect/react) uses [ESLint](/linter/overview) to lint components.

```bash
bit lint
```

```bash
bit lint --fix
```

To learn more about linting components and the Linter, head over to the [Linter documentation](/linter/overview) section.

## Formatting

By default, component formatting is configured to work with [Prettier](/formatter/overview) on all official envs.

```bash
bit format
```

To learn more about the Formatter, please head over to the [Formatter documentation](/formatter/overview) section.
