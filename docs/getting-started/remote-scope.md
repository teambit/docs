You can create a remote scope before or after [initializing a Bit workspace](initializing-workspace).

## What is a Scope?

A scope is where the release versions of Bit components are stored. Remote scopes, either on [Bit.dev](https://bit.dev) or other self-hosted Bit servers, store exported components that are available to be used by other web projects.

## Create a Bit.dev account

<CreateBitAccount />

## Create a Remote Scope

<CreateRemoteScope />

## Updating the Default Scope

Once you have setup a [remote scope](remote-scope) you may need to configure the `workspace.jsonc` to reflect the correct username and scope.

<DefaultScopeName />

### Resetting the Dev Server

<ResetDevServer />

## What's Next?

Once you have created your remote scope and configured your defaultScope you can then create more components, compose components or [export your components](exporting-components) to the remote scope so they can be published and installed in other Bit workspaces or in other web projects.
