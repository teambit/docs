You can compose components together from other components in your workspace or from components in the cloud.

<!-- ## Creating Components with Bit Create

To create other components you can use `bit create react-component` followed by your component name and the namespace for that component.

<BitCreateCardComponent />

<Styles />

### Namespaces

<NameSpaces />

### Component Location

<Path />

## Install Dependencies

<TestDependencies />

---

## Show Component

<BitShow />

## Composing Components

When importing a component into another component Bit doesn't allow for relative require/import statements, as this couples your component to a specific directory structure, instead you use the component's package name. In the workspace UI you will see the package name for your component which you can copy to import it.

<CardExample />

### Your Component in the Workspace

In your workspace UI you will now see your card component rendered with the button component inside it.

### Component Module Links

Bit creates a module for each component in the workspace. These modules are linked in the node_modules directory and contains it's build output and auto-generated package.json. To see this in your workspace, browse the `node_modules/@my-scope/ui.button` directory.

To import a component as a dependency you must use the module link. This way your component is not coupled to a specific directory structure in the workspace, which makes them transferable between workspaces.

#### Generating module links

To regenerate module-links for components run the `bit link` command.

:::tip

Use `bit link --help` or `bit link -h` to get a list of available options for this command.

## What's Next?

It's time to create a [Remote Scope](remote-scope) so you can see you component on the [Bit.dev](https://bit.dev) cloud and then export it and import it into another application.
