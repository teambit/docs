In order to initialize a workspace you will need to first [install Bit](installing-bit).

## Bit Workspace

A Bit Workspace enables you to author and manage multiple independent components in a simple and elegant way. First setup a new Git repo for your project and then initialize the Bit workspace.

```sh
git init
```

<BitInit />

## Created Files

<FilesBitCreates />

## What's Next

Once you have initialized a workspace you can then start [creating components](creating-components).
