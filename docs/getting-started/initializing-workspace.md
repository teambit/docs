In order to initialize a workspace you will need to first [install Bit](installing-bit). A Bit Workspace enables you to author and manage multiple independent components in a simple and elegant way. Bit works with Git so you can either add init a new git repo or add Bit to an existing git repo.

**There are two ways you can initialize a workspace:**

## Option 1: Use bit new to create a React workspace

Create a new Bit workspace for a React environment. This command will initialize a Bit Harmony workspace configured for a React environment. To create a workspace and manually configure the env use the `bit init --harmony` command.

:::info Experimental Feature
This is experimental and may change in the future. If you experience any issues with this command please let us know.
:::

Start a new Bit workspace with a React environment.

:::note Action Required

```bash
bit new react-workspace <my-workspace-name>
```

:::

Install all dependencies needed for your workspace.

:::note Action Required

```bash
bit install
```

## Option 2: Use bit init to initialize and manually configure your workspace

<BitInit />

:::tip

Use `bit init --help` or `bit init -h` to get a list of available options for this command.

Once you have initialized a workspace, you can start [creating components](creating-components).
