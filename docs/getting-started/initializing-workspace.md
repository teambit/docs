In order to initialize a workspace you will need to first [install Bit](installing-bit).

## Bit Workspace

A Bit Workspace enables you to author and manage multiple independent components in a simple and elegant way. First setup a new Git repo for your project and then initialize the Bit workspace.

```bash
git init
```

## Bit New React Workspace

Start a new Bit workspace with a React environment.

```bash
bit new react-environment <my-project-name>
```

Install all dependencies

```bash
bit install
```
