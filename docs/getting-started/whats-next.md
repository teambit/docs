Well done on making it to the end of the Getting Started section. So far you have [Installed Bit](installing-bit), [initialized a workspace](initializing-workspace), [created a component](creating-components), [explored the workspace UI](workspace-ui), [created a remote scope](creating-components), [exported a component](exporting-components) and [installed a component](installing-components).

Are you ready to go deeper. We have so much more to show you.

> **Using Bit on pre-existing projects**
>
> If you have components in projects you are actively working on, please refer to [this guide](/reference/pre-existing-components).

## Essentials

Check out [Essentials](/essentials/what-is-bit) to understand more about What Bit is and its advantages.

## Building with Bit

Check out [Building with Bit](/building-with-bit/manage-workspace), a more in-depth guide on using Bit including [documenting components](/building-with-bit/documenting-components), [testing components](/building-with-bit/testing-components), [versioning components](/building-with-bit/versioning-components) and much more as well as how to use [Bit with pre-existing components](/reference/pre-existing-components).

## Component Architecture

Check out [Component Architecture](/component-architecture/thinking-in-components) to learn more about how to think in Components.

## Bit Aspects

Check out [Bit Aspects](/aspects/aspects-overview), to see the building blocks of Bit. You can implement new Aspects, compose them with Bit's core Aspects and thus extending Bit's core functionality to support advanced features.

## Resources

Check out our [Resources](/resources/conference-talks) section to see talks, live streams, podcasts and articles on Bit.

## Bit's Commands

Check out all of [Bit's commands](/reference/commands) in the Reference Chapter.
