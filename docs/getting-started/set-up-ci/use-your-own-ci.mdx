title: Automate Component Export
---

To ensure a component is built and published in a consistent manner its recommended to use CI.  
The `tag` command versions components, but as this is a local command, we need to provide it with the parameters to run on a remote server. Bit features a **soft** and **persist** options for `tag` to manage a remote runs for component versioning as follows:

1. In your project run `bit tag` with the `--soft` option to annotate that modified components should be versioned and exported.
1. Bit will update `.bitmap` with information on which components should be versioned.
1. Commit changes and publish a pull request to your Git repository.
1. Get results of the PR build and collaborate on the soon-to-be published components.
1. Merge changes to main branch.
1. CI versions all marked components and publish them.
1. CI commits back to the repository the updated `.bitmap` in a post-export state.

## Step-by-step

Below are the steps you should follow to automate component export.

### Install and authenticate Bit

Your CI container should have Bit installed and authenticated with your remote Bit server(s). You can use `bvm` to install Bit.  
Authenticating Bit depends on how you host your Bit servers. If using a self-hosted Bit server you should manage authentication as you set it up for yourself.

### "soft" tag components

When your feature branch is done and you want to mark which components are published, their next version and a changelog message use `--soft` option.

```sh title="soft tag components"
bit tag --soft --all --message "my message"
```

Bit then update `.bitmap` for all modified components and their dependents with the new version and the changelog message. Commit changes and push your branch.

```sh
git commit -am "my message" && git push
```

### Build modified components

When developing in a local workspace Bit prioritize performance and dev experience for the test and build process of each component. When you open a PR with changes to components it's recommended for Bit to run the entire isolation process for each component. To run a component complete build pipeline and have Bit ensure component isolation run the `build` command:

```sh title="build command prioritize isolation over performance"
bit build
```

Use the PR to collaborate on components and merge changes to main branch.

### Merge, version and publish

When soft-tagged components are merged to the main branch your CI should run the `tag` command to version and publish the components.

```sh title="persist soft tags"
bit tag --persist
```

After new versions are persisted to Bit's storage you can safely export:

```sh title="export components"
bit export
```

### Commit back to the repository

The aforementioned steps would cause `.bitmap` file to be updated. It's important to commit back these changes to the repository.

```sh title="commit changes to repository"
git add .bitmap
git commit -m "update .bitmap with new component versions (automated). [skip-ci]"
git push
```

:::info using `skip-ci`
Ensure your CI system has a feature to skip-ci on the commit-back step, otherwise your CI will try to run another CI step without your intention.

## Examples

Below are some examples/references to help you get started with your CI.

:::note
Below examples assume you use [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) to host your components.

### Using GitHub Actions

> You can also follow along with this [example project.](https://github.com/teambit/harmony-with-github-actions)

1. Create a new [secret variable](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) in your Github repository. Name it `BIT_TOKEN` and set the value of it to the `user.token` value.
1. Create a new `tag-and-export.yml` file in your remote repository `./.github/workflows` directory.
1. Create your script.

Here's a demo script you can start with:

```yaml
# This workflow hard-tags and exports soft-tagged components
name: Tag and Export Components

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  tag-and-export:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '--skip-ci')"
    env:
      BIT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.BIT_TOKEN }}

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js 12
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12.x
      - name: Install Bit Version Manager
        run: npm i -g @teambit/bvm
      - name: Install latest Bit version
        run: bvm install
      - name: add bvm bin folder to path
        run: echo "$HOME/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH
      - name: Set up bit config
        run: |
          bit config set analytics_reporting false
          bit config set anonymous_reporting false
          bit config set user.token $BIT_TOKEN
      - name: Install packages using bit
        run: bit install
      - name: Hard-tag pending components
        run: bit tag --persist
      - name: Export components
        run: bit export
      - name: Commit changes made to .bitmap
        run: |
          git config --global user.name '${{ github.actor }}'
          git config --global user.email '${{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com'
          git add .bitmap
          git commit -m "update .bitmap with new component versions (automated). --skip-ci"
          git push
```

### Using GitLab CI

1. Generate a Personal Access Token with "Read Repository" and "Write Repository" permissions (this will be `GL_TOKEN`).
1. Generate `BIT_TOKEN` by grabbing it from your local "bit config" output.
1. Configure both tokens as project variables for your GitLab project and name them `GL_TOKEN` and `BIT_USER_TOKEN`.
1. Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root of the repository.
1. Create your script.

Here's a demo script you can start with:

```yml
publish_components:
  image: node:latest
  only: master
  script:
    # Install Bit and configure permissions
    - npm i -g @teambit/bvm
    - bvm install
    - export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
    - bit config set analytics_reporting false
    - bit config set anonymous_reporting false
    - bit config set user.token $BIT_TOKEN
    # Install dependencies
    - bit install
    # Version all pending components
    - bit tag --persist
    # Export components
    - bit export
    # Setup Git and commit back .bitmap changes
    - git config --global user.email "some@email.address"
    - git config --global user.name "some ci account"
    - export GL_RELEASE_GITLAB_API_TOKEN=$GL_TOKEN
    # This checkout is a workaround for the "error: src refspec master does not match any." error
    - git checkout master
    # Add the modified ".bitmap" file
    - git add .
    # Replace origin with authenticated origin
    - git remote rm origin
    - git remote add origin https://[repo-owner]:$GL_RELEASE_GITLAB_API_TOKEN@gitlab.com/[repo-ower]/[repo-name].git
    # Using [skip ci] as its a feature for GitLab that will not trigger CI for this commit
    - git commit -am 'publish components [skip ci]'
    - git pull origin master
    - git push origin master
```
