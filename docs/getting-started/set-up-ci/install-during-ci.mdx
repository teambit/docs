Package managers use the `.npmrc` file to know where they should install dependencies from. This means that if a project depends on components, that file should contain the configuration for where the components are located.

## Configure `.npmrc`

Npm and yarn respect the following file locations:

- per-project config file (`/path/to/my/project/.npmrc`)
- per-user config file (`~/.npmrc`)
- global config file (`$PREFIX/etc/npmrc`)
- npm builtin config file (`/path/to/npm/npmrc`)

If you already use such configuration file you may append the configuration relevant for Bit in it.

### Components on [bit.dev](https://bit.dev)

All components hosted on Bit.dev are accesible from the `https://node.bit.dev` domain with your account as a `registry`. To install components directly from there configure the following in your `.npmrc` file:

```sh
@ACCOUNT-NAME:registry=https://node.bit.dev
//node.bit.dev/:_authToken=TOKEN
```

Replace the `ACCOUNT-NAME` with your account name and `TOKEN` with your token. To get a machine token follow [these steps](https://TODO).

### Components published on a remote registry

If you are publishing your components on a remote registry or integrated your registry to cache exported components from [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) configure your `.npmrc` with that information.

## Common Errors

### 'package not found' (404) when importing a component

NPM or Yarn throws 'package not found' when importing a component. This is likely because the component has a dependency on a @bit component. Make sure `.npmrc` is configured.

### Unauthorized (401) when installing a component

Possible reasons:

- npmrc is not properly configured.
- You do not have the right permissions on the Collection that the components are hosted in, and are therefore unable to access its components. Make sure you have at least read permissions for the collection that host the components.
- Yarn does not send an authentication token when installing packages from a `yarn.lock` file. This is a [known issue](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/4451). Make sure `always-auth` is configured in `.npmrc`.

## Examples

You can use these examples as a reference for configuring your `.npmrc` file.

### Manually create npmrc file

You can add a `.npmrc` in your project with the following:

```shell
@<account-name>:registry=https://node.bit.dev
@teambit:registry=https://node.bit.dev
//node.bit.dev/:_authToken=${BIT_TOKEN}
always-auth=true
```

Define `BIT_TOKEN` as a secret global variable on the server.

### Generate `.npmrc` on server

To generate the file dynamically, you need to run the following script (e.g. create a `bit_npm.sh` script):

```shell
echo "Adding bit.dev to npm registry"
echo "always-auth=true" >> ~/.npmrc
echo "@<account-name>:registry=https://node.bit.dev" >> ~/.npmrc
echo "@teambit:registry=https://node.bit.dev" >> ~/.npmrc
echo "//node.bit.dev/:_authToken={$BIT_TOKEN}" >> ~/.npmrc
echo "Completed adding bit.dev to npm registry"
```

### Netlify

On Netlify, [you cannot generate the file dynamically](https://community.netlify.com/t/common-issue-using-private-npm-modules-on-netlify/795/11), and you should [add `.npmrc` file in your project](#define-npmrc-in-the-project).

Add the BIT_TOKEN as [environment variable](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#environment-variables)

### Vercel

On Vercel add `NPM_RC` as an [environment variable](https://vercel.com/docs/build-step#using-environment-variables-and-secrets) with the contents of your `~/.npmrc` file.

### Gitlab

In `.gitlab-ci.yml` run the script that [generates the file for the user](#generate-npmrc-on-server) as an initial step before running npm install.

Add the BIT_TOKEN as an [environment variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/)

### GitHub actions

Add the BIT_TOKEN as a [secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) in GitHub.

In the GitHub workflow file, create a step before the npm install section:

```shell
- name: init bit.dev
  run: |
    echo "Adding bit.dev to npm registry"
    npm config set @bit:registry https://node.bit.dev
    npm config set @<account-name>:registry=https://node.bit.dev
    npm config set @teambit:registry=https://node.bit.dev
    npm config set //node.bit.dev/:_authToken ${BIT_TOKEN}
    echo "Completed adding bit.dev to npm registry"
  env:
    BIT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.BIT_TOKEN }}
```

### Heroku

To generate the `.npmrc` before installing dependencies, run a pre-build script as described [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support#heroku-specific-build-steps).

Add the `BIT_TOKEN` as an [environment variable](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#managing-config-vars)

### Azure pipelines

Use the [npm authenticate task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/package/npm-authenticate?view=azure-devops) to setup the `.npmrc` configuration in your pipeline.
