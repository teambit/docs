## Bit is the platform for modular web development - Build modular web applications together in a fast, scalable, and fun way.  

Bit helps you build modern web applications in a modular way. With Bit, many teams and developers can easily build a large, modern web application together. Instead of working in one cumbersome monolith, Bit decouples the development of components at every step from writing code to building, testing, and even releasing changes. This means for example that many teams can independently develop and release features to production at the same time, integrating each other's components in build-time, while all teams can share and collaborate on components with each other.  

The result is similar to that of what microservices did for the backend: faster, better, and much more scalable development.  

Bit also puts a strong emphasis on **developer experience** - to provide developers with a simple, fun, performant, and even visual experience for developing modern web applications from independent components.

#### How?

Bit’s workspace turns any project into a powerful multi-component monorepo. It helps developers build projects in a modular way, so each component is independently developed, tested, built, rendered, linted, documented, versioned, and published. All components and dependencies are managed in a simple harmonic “monolith-like” developer experience with smooth control over all changes to your code or your development environment.

Bit’s cloud platform helps teams collaborate on components and build together. Organizations can distribute web development into autonomous teams that build apps/features in decoupled codebases. All teams can easily share components, collaborate, and integrate with each other. Each team can develop and release components autonomously, and get tools to standardize and manage components across teams and projects.  

**Bit is used by thousands of teams**, including some of the world’s best tech organizations whose products you use every day. Join us to build better web applications faster together too.

> * Bit components can be anything from UI components to Hooks, Widgets, Pages, Features or even Node Modules. You decide what should be componentized first.
> * Bit only lives in build time. It does not add runtime dependencies to your code, and does not affect how you implement components.

### Micro Frontends

#### Read -> “[How We Build Micro Frontends](https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-we-build-micro-front-ends-d3eeeac0acfc)”

![Micro Frontends](https://i.ibb.co/fn8krfn/homepage-components-micro-frontends.png)

*Micro frontends* are a philosophy of how software should be built, and how teams and organizations should work together. Bit is the most production-ready and scalable way to build Micro Frontends, driven by modern components.

* **Decoupled Codebases** - Each team can develop components in their own codebase, which is decoupled in every way during development from all other teams’ codebases.
* **Team API ownerships** - Autonomous teams can own and expose components and features as APIs to all other teams, via Bit’s cloud, so that everyone can continuously integrate.
* **Build-time integrations** - Teams can easily discover and install each other’s components in their own components, and compose components together to release modular applications.
* **Incremental upgrades** - Each team can constantly release updates to specific components and easily make sure all impacted components, teams, and applications will get all and only the updates they need, and that incremental builds and test allow the safe release of upgrades.
* **Independent releases** - Teams no longer have to fight over master or step on each other’s toes, as each component can be built using its own build environments and even build pipelines. All teams can constantly deliver innovation safely and independently to production.
Need an example? Take a look at how the [homepage of Bit.dev](https://bit.dev) is composed of components built by different teams, in different codebases, released independently, and smoothly integrated together.

### UI Design System

#### Read -> “[How We Build Our Design System](https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-we-build-our-design-system-15713a1f1833)”

![Design system](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/bit-design-system.jpeg)

*Design systems* are how great teams keep their UI consistent across multiple pages and applications. Modern design systems are built with components, which are used as shared building blocks to ensure consistency. Bit is a perfect way for teams to distribute, discover, use, and collaborate on their component-driven design system. And, it’s also a great way for developers to include more people, like designers, in their web development process.

* **Collaborative component ecosystem** - Bit is how teams work together to build a thriving, collaborative, and beautiful component ecosystem for all developers. Everyone can develop components in their own applications, share components with each other via the component cloud, discover and use other people’s components, easily suggest feedback and changes, and enjoy an harmonic balance between innovation, delivery, and consistency.
* **Ensure consistency in design and code** - Bit helps you standardize the development of components and visualize all UI changes in real time to help you ensure every component and every change will meet both your team’s design and development release criteria.
* **Universal hub for components** - All your components are hosted, shared, and exposed on the component cloud. Every team can own and expose its own components, while easily finding and consuming components exposed by other teams, all in one secured and manageable place.
* **Develop independent components** - Bit provides the richest and most powerful component development toolset available in the world, to help your build independent reusable components which can be quickly integrated and used in new projects and new environments.
* **Distribute independent components** - Bit makes it easy to export many components from any project, as independently versioned packages. Don’t install (or be forced to update) entire libraries just to gain access to a few APIs.
* **Incremental component updates** - With Bit you only get updates to components you actually use, and don’t have to update a whole library for no reason. And, Bit auto-detects which components are impacted by every change, so it helps you easily and safely adopt changes into your project without breaking anything. Staying updated made simple and painless.
* **Component usage analytics** - In the component cloud you can learn which projects and which teams adopted which updates to what components. Learn the exact status of every component in every app, and gain actionable insights on your entire UI development.
* **Scalable discovery and documentation** - Bit turns documentation into a native and almost seamless part of creating components. It combines auto-generated API reference, MDX and other formats, visual examples, rendered compositions and many other doc features to create the richest and most simple to consume docs for every component. When you publish to the component cloud, all these docs are hosted in the cloud as a part of every component. **No extra tools or websites required**.
* **Automated GitHub updates** - Bit.dev offers a GitHub integration, so that when a new component version is released, Bit automates the creation of pull-requests in every impacted GitHub repository, with all relevant information such as build results etc already included in the PR. And, at any moment, you can view who merged which PRs into which projects.
* **Automated Slack updates** - Bit.dev offers a GitHub integration, so that when a new component version is released, Slack notifications will be sent to all relevant people whose projects are impacted by the change. Nudging is now automated!
* **Developer-designer handshake** - Bit visualizes the code of your UI component to designers, and helps them learn exactly how every component looks and behaves as seen by users, at any given moment in time, and in every version. When a new version is released, simply ask designers to review the change - they will be able to see exactly what components are impacted by the change, how each of them will look, and give feedback. You can even [automate this process](https://blog.bitsrc.io/introducing-bit-dev-webhooks-78dade77c6da) to create tasks for designers to review every component change before its published.

### Component Monorepo

Bit helps you build a modular and scalable multi-component monorepo. It provides a fully decoupled and modular way to develop, built, test, lint, publish etc many components in one project, while keeping a simple and holistic developer experience.

![Component-monorepo-2](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/component-monorepo.png)

Bit covers all aspects of building a multi-project monorepo, and even provides a beautiful UI where you can easily master and navigate the development of your modular project.

Key features include:

* **Seperated, reusable, customizable dev environments** - Reusable and customizable modules that configures and “bundles” together different services needed throughout the life-cycle of an independent component such as compiling, bundling, testing, linting, documenting, and more.
* **Mastery of the component graph**  -  Bit defines, manages, and helps you leverage the relationship between all components in your project. At any time, you can visit the dependencies tab in Bit’s UI to learn exactly which components depend on other components. It uses this information to allow incremental propagating builds and tests, bulk publishing based on automated change detection, and more powerful features.
* **Decoupled, incremental, propagating builds** - Bit only build changes to impacted components on the graph. Each change propagates infinitely to all impacted components on the graph. Nothing else but the impacted components is built. Every impacted component is built in isolation to ensure its fully safe to deploy changes.
* **Auto detecting changes and bumping impacted components** - When you make a change to a component, Bit automatically detects which other components depend on the changed component, and “knows” to build only the impacted graph of dependent components - with infinite propagation. Building changes across many components in your project becomes a blazing fast yet surprisingly simple task that is mostly automated.
* **Isolated incremental component testing** - Each component is tested in isolation using a test environment which is also a reusable module. As you code you can view the test results reload in Bit’s UI, to know exactly if the component breaks or not. As you test the component, via ‘bit test’ or by releasing a new version etc, Bit will detect and test all impacted components up the dpandats graph, to make sure your changes will not break any other component.
* **Component symlinking** lets ‘bit install’ build components that depend on other components that did not yet been tagged with a matching version.
* **Modular bulk publishing** - Every component developed in a Bit monorepo is, by design, ready to be published as a standalone package. Bit strips aways all the overhead of configuring each component’s ‘package.json’ and other setup files. All you have to do is run ‘bit tag’ so that Bit will auto tag all changed components with a version bump (supporting semver rules), and then bulk publish changes to all impacted components. Each component published to the bit.dev cloud platform will be available to find and install, with every part of the local UI view available on the cloud as auto-updating documentation, including API reference, examples, compositions, dependency graphs, test results, code and more.
* **Component changelogs and history** - Every component has its own changelog and version history so it’s very easy to view and learn about changes in Bit’s UI or on the cloud.
* **Component docs and examples** - Every component is documented using reusable and customizable templates, and Bit automates much of the work for you. Working with MDX? No problem, Bit supports almost any format you’d like to use to create beautiful docs.
* **Compositions rendered in isolation** - Every component is rendered in full isolation, literally outside of the project, and these visuals (which hot-reload as you code) become a part of each component’s documentation when developing locally, and in the cloud.
* **Component build pipelines** - You can pipe build jobs in a reusable pipeline that can be applied to all components in a project or in all of your team’s projects, in order to easily standardize the development and release process of your web applications. For example, company “Acme” can define “Acme Release Pipeline” with specific configurations which will standardize how all components in Acme will be tested, built and released.
* **Extend, replace, or customize anything** - Bit is 100% modular. Every part of Bit is a reusable, extendable, and customizable module. Including everything - dev environments, build environments, the UI, docs templates, the workspace, build pipelines, everything. You can easily and quickly change, remove, add, or replace any part of Bit, your toolchain, or workflow. You can even add features to the workspace UI to enrich your experience. It’s just a matter of composing a few components.

### Developer Designer Collaboration

Bit is a very effective way to bridge the gap between design and development. Unlike legacy tools, it helps developers include designers (and other people) in the development process.

![Developer Designer Collaboration](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/Overview-bitdev.png)

* **Visualize all components for designers and everyone else** - Bit brings everyone in the team together directly over components. All components implemented by developers become visually available to designers, product managers, marketers and everyone else.
* **Notify designers and visualize all component changes and new versions** - All changes and new versions to components to components are available to designers to see and track, so they can easily compare changes and ensure a beautiful consistent design.
* **Preview and visualize all released changes to components in all projects** - *Ripple CI* lets teams release component changes to all impacted projects. Each change on each impacted component is **visualized in a live preview** during the build process, so that designers can learn exactly how releases impact the visual design of every screen and application.
* **Integrate Zeplin, Figma and other tools for UI creation utopia** - Imagine all your design components on Figma and Zeplin connected to the actual component implemented by developers and to the code that runs in production. Every change is updated and compared in code and design. This can be done with Bit, to achieve UI development utopia where designers and developers build together, for real.
* **Let designers actively actively participate by editing and saving visual changes** - *Coming soon!*: Enjoy visual editing features to help designers instantly give feedback, suggest changes, and ultimately release changes to code components right from the component cloud.

### 3X Development Speed

* **Reuse 100% of your components to greatly speed up development** - Each component reused is hours or days of work saved by a developer. Taking components to the cloud will save organizations up to 50% of development time and resources, and focus them on innovation.
* **Eliminate bugs, mistakes, and inconsistencies in web projects** - Customize, standardize, and reuse development environments, documentation templates, and build pipelines to eliminate up to 90%(!) of all component inconsistencies, bugs, and mistakes in production.
* **Save 90% time and overhead on integrations between teams and projects** - Every component is available to everyone in the organization on the component cloud. All components can be quickly introduced into different projects by simply importing them into the project’s workspace and integrating them to other components in the workspace. Teams report Bit to save roughly 40% of time spent on their cross-team integrations.
* **Shorten the feedback loop between developers, designers, and everyone** - Save A LOT of time on designer and developer collaboration through [developer and designer collaboration](###developer-designer-collaboration). Visualize all components, let designers view all components, versions, and changes, and integrate your favorite design tools. Shorten product and feature feedback loops by up to 50% and greatly improve outcome quality.
* **Ripple CI: Hyper fast modular builds without fighting over master** - Unlike legacy tools, *Ripple CI* does not build an entire monolithic application. Instead, it only builds propagating changes to impacted components making it A LOT faster than anything you’ve known. It incrementally builds changes to components on the graph, so each team can independently and rapidly release changes to their components without stepping on other team’s toes.
* **Reduce time and overhead and remove external tools from your toolchain** - No more external documentation websites, monorep development tools, publishing tools, or different dev and build tools used by different teams for no reason. Bit will let you choose, reuse, and standardize the best tools, and remove any extra tools to build with components.

### Sharing and Reusing Components

Bit is a very effective way to share and reuse code between teams.

With Bit, each team can easily create and publish components from their own independent codebase. Via the component cloud, all teams can share and discover each other’s components, and quickly integrate them into different projects. Advanced features make this process more collaborative, so it becomes very easy to suggest feedback and changes to shared code, build together, and stay in sync.

The ease of publishing alongside the ease of discovery and reuse make Bit a highly scalable solution for sharing code between teams. Bit can be used to share UI components, but also any other form of reusable code units like Hooks or even Node modules, util functions, serverless functions and more.

## Core Features

[Bit](https://github.com/teambit/bit) is a rich and extendable open-source toolset for modular development including a component workspace, customizable reusable component dev environments, standard build pipelines, dependency-graph resolutions, and more.

The [Bit.dev cloud platform](https://bit.dev/) is an enterprise-grade solution for developers to share and collaborate on components, continuously integrate with changes with each other, and make sure that all applications are always up to date with the latest versions.

## Open Source Development Tools

### Lego-Like Component Workspace

* **Dynamically add, import, and export components**
* **Personalize your workspace and work only what you need**
* **Auto-define and manage all component dependencies**
* **Abstract away all painful configurations with the simple ‘workspace.json’**
* **Enjoy a smooth and holistic dev experience**

Bit’s workspace turns your project into a smart “monorepo” where components are fully decoupled from each other during every step of their development, build, test, and publish process. Bit will ensure each component is completely independent, while helping you manage and synchronize all components in your project with an effortless and holistic developer experience. It is a bedrock for truly modular and harmonized development.

![Component-monorepo-workspace](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/monorepo-components-bit.png)

### Modular Component Dev Environments

* **Use or create modular per-component dev environments**
* **Easily apply different environments to components**
* **Develop, build, test, lint etc each component individually**
* **Reuse environments across components and projects**

A Bit Environment is a component that configures and “bundles” together different services needed throughout the life-cycle of an independent component. These services include compiling, bundling, testing, linting, documenting, and more. A single workspace can maintain several types of development environment (Angular, React, Vue, etc) for different types of components, without requiring that you manage multiple processes.

Bit environments make it possible to build and deliver independent components without the overhead of setting up a development environment to support that. Environments are also used to ensure consistency by standardizing the environment setup for independent components, developed across various projects by different teams.

![component-dev-environments](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/Screen%20Shot%202020-11-10%20at%202.56.23%20PM.png)

### Visual Development UI

* **Spawn a visual UI with a powerful dev server and hot reloading**
* **Render and visualize your components in isolation**
* **View and edit beautiful component documentations**
* **Run and view component build and tests results as you code**
* **Visualize and manage your component dependency graph**
* **Quickly browse versions and changelogs**
* **Explore your project’s beautiful component gallery**

Bit makes sure that not only you get an A+ dev experience for modular projects, but also that you enjoy it visually. Open Bit’s powerful UI to visually develop, build, test, manage and render the components in your project with instant feedback as you code.

And, the entire Bit UI is made of components too, so you can customize and extend the UI to include any feature or look any way you like. We do it all the time!

![component-dev-server](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/Workspace-Grid%20(1).png)  

### Reusable Docs Templates

Make documentation an integral part of how you build components, using customizable and reusable templates that turn your code into beautiful docs. And, render and add visual compositions of components to see and learn how it works in different contexts and with its different dependencies or dependants. All with live hot reloading. When done, place your docs on [Bit.dev](https://bit.dev/) for everyone else to discover and enjoy!

![docs-and-compositions](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/Compositions%20(1).png)

### Component Dependency Graphs

Bit is smart, it tracks and “knows” about the relationships between all components in your workspace. When you make a change, Bit “knows” which other components are impacted by the change, and helps you safely propagate the change to all impacted components while making sure they will still pass their build and tests. You can easily view and manage each component’s dependency graph, or the entire graph of your project, right in your local development UI.

![component-dependencies](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/Dependencies%20(1).png)

### Component Versions and History

Each component is versioned individually and has its own changelog so you can keep track of changes easily and quickly. View each component’s history, travel between versions, to easily learn what changed, by who, and when.

![component-history](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/History.png)

### Isolated Component Builds and Testing

Build and test each component in complete isolation using predefined and customizable test environments, which can also be added into your pipelines. See builds and tests running live on every change as you code, to create bulletproof independent components that run anywhere.

![component-tests](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/Tests.png)

#### Component Build Pipelines

Build helps you standardize the build pipeline of all your components. Define jobs in a pipeline according to your best standards and make sure that all components are released through the same steps. Bit will even help you automate these workflows so that all components will go through these pipeline every time their builds will run.

![component-builds](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/component-builds.png)

#### Incrementally Propagating Builds

 When you make a change in your project, Bit “knows” exactly which components are impacted by that change. It uses this information to rebuild and retest only the components impacted by the change, and infinitely propagates this process to all impacted dependents. The result? X30 (!) faster build times and surgical ability to pin-poin the impact of changes on the graph.

### Independent Component Publishing
 
Enjoy 100% reusability for all components as a seamless side effect of your development workflow. Publish independent components in your workspace as individual packages without having to split your project, define complex configurations, or do anything else but simply developing your components in Bit’s workspace.

![component-builds](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.bit.dev/harmony-docs/yarn%20and%20npm.png)

### Scopes

A “Scope” is a lightweight component server that provides a rich API for accessing, persisting and versioning components. Scopes host and organize your components so that they can be easily managed, exposed, and integrated into new environments.

### Ripple CI - The world’s 1st cross-project modular CI (*Join Beta!*)

* **Build changes to all impacted components up the graph, across multiple projects**
* **Incrementally build changes to impacted components, nothing else, for x10+ performance**
* **Preview all changes with live rendering to help ensure design consistency and quality**
* **Build and test each impacted component individually to learn exactly what breaks and why**
* **Fast and fearless; No more fighting over master, no more waiting for bloated versions**

*Ripple CI* is continuous integration for the entire organization. It incrementally builds, tests, and even visually previews changes to components across all your applications simultaneously. This means you can release incremental changes to many teams and projects together.  
It builds and tests only impacted components, so you don’t have to build an entire application. The result is roughly 12x faster build times than the best CI tools we benchmarked. It also means that different people, or teams, can release changes at the same time without fighting over master, stepping on each other’s toes, or waiting for versions to bloat.  
Since all changes to all impacted components are *visualized in rendered previews*, designers and everyone else can take a hands-on part of the release process. No more breaking each other’s code, design, or experience ever again.

Want to join some of the world’s best teams on the Beta? [Let us know](https://bit.dev/contact-sales).
