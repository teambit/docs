A fundamental feature of a Bit workspace is the ability to vendor components. This means you can use a single command, and instead of adding a component as a dependency, you import that component's implementation to your workspace, as-if you are its author.

:::info Compatible with Bit workspaces

Using `bit import` requires the consumer to be a Bit workspace as a prerequisite.

## Importing a Component

```bash
bit import my-org.my-scope/my-teams-component
```

You may also use glob patterns to import multiple components with a single command:

```bash title="Imports all components in the remote scope"
bit import "<owner>.<scope>/*"
```

```bash title="Imports all component under the namespace in a remote scope"
bit import "<owner>.<scope>/<namespace>/*"
```

Bit imports all components to the local scope, create a directory for the component according to the workspace directory structure, and check-out the latest version to the workspace, adds an entry to `.bitmap` and creates a module in `node_modules`.  
These steps makes imported component be identical to all other components in the workspace.

## Working with Imported Components

You can do local modifications to it, commit to your Git repository and work with it as if it is yours, even to the point of exporting a new version for that component.

Managing imported components works just the same as managing components originated from your workspace:

- Use `bit start` to show component in the local workspace UI.
- Run component operations like compile, test, format and lint with the `compile`, `test`, `format` and `lint` commands.
- Commit local changes for components to your SCM.

## Eject components

You can remove a component from the codebase and turn it to a dependency with the `eject` command:

```sh
bit eject my-teams-component
```

Bit then removes the component code from your code base and adds that component as a dependency to your `workspace.jsonc`.
