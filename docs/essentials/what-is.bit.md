title: What is Bit
---

Bit is a tool for composing modern applications of independent components.  

It extends the benefits of micro-services to everything you build, front and back. With Bit teams can autonomously develop, build, and release components, while continuously collaborating and integrating to compose larger applications together.  

Bit's extendible toolset (and visual development UI) creates a simple yet powerful experience for every developer, while larger teams can smoothly scale to build many developers and projects in the component cloud.

Modularity benefits almost every part of the development process, from speeding up releases to making debugging or refactoring much simpler. You can start enjoying Bit through one of many popular use-cases such as Micro Frontends, Design Systems, Development Speed, and Collaboration on components.

## Develop modular web applications together in a fast and scalable way

While the modern web makes components its first-class citizens, many modern web projects are still being built in a cumbersome monolithic way, as different features and the developers who build them are tightly coupled to each other, slowing down development and making it hard to build together.  

**Bit modularizes the development of modern web applications**.      

With Bit large modern web applications can be composed by different teams building features side by side via scopes of components. Each team can autonomously develop, expose, and integrate components. All components are developed in isolation and can be easily integrated in build time as standalone versioned and updated building blocks. Through the cloud, this process can be effectively scaled to many teams building many web applications together.      

Web development becomes **faster**, more **scalable** and highly **standardized**. Application users enjoy new features more frequently released, bugs can be quickly fixed or replaced, and user experience remains consistent at every touchpoint.  

### How?  

Bit is a standard infrastructure for component-driven development. It provides an extendable toolchain to develop, build, test, and integrate components in a modular and scalable way.  

Bit’s workspace enables the distributed development of modular web projects, turning any web project into a “monorepo” composed of components. Every feature is a **scope of components**. Each scope of components contains everything its owner team needs in order to deliver: UI components, data-connected components, React hooks, Node modules, and even serverless functions.  

All teams expose and share components with each other, and can continuously integrate components in build-time while constantly releasing fast automated updates to each other. Through the cloud, collaboration and integration are smoothly scaled to many teams building many modular web projects together.  

**Bit is used by thousands of teams**, including some of the world’s best and largest tech organizations. Join us to build modular web applications together too.  

In the words of [Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/first/): 

*“The secret to efficiently building ‘large’ things is generally to avoid building them in the first place. Instead, compose your large thing out of smaller, more focused pieces.”*  

### Developer Experience

Bit is focused on creating a simple, performant, and highly flexible developer experience that makes it easy to scale the development of complex-multi component web projects. 

With over 600 APIs every part of Bit - from dev environments to the UI - can be extended and customized to fit your best experience. And, any extension is a Bit component, so it can be easily integrated and reused in different projects and shared with more people.  

Bit is extremely lightweight and leaves nearly 0 footprint on your project. Since everything happens in build-time, not code-changes or runtime dependencies are required. 

### We build Bit with Bit

We build Bit with Bit. Every part of Bit and even Bit.dev is 100% made of Bit components. Bit makes it easy for us to open-source every component we can regardless of its parent project, so you can learn how we build and view the scopes/teams we work in at our [official TeamBit account](https://bit.dev/teambit). 

### Key Concepts

**Component** -  The word “component” can describe any software component that has a clear and well-defined business functionality. In the world of modern web development, components can be UI primitives, whether simple or “smart” data-connected components, Hooks, entire features like a search bar with buttons and filters, and even a full page. Components can also be used in the backend, as anything from simple utility functions to more complex Node modules.  

While most people find it simpler to start with UI components, you can take a [look here]( to learn how we work with Bit and what’s really possible.  

**Workspace** - The Bit component Workspace provides a monolithic dev experience for building fully distributed applications from independent components. It lets you develop each components in isolations and compose it with other components in the workspace. Components can be dynamically added, imported, or removed from the workspace so you can work on what you need when you need to, in a modular way.  

It helps developers build in a modular way, so each component is independently developed, tested, built, rendered, linted, documented, versioned, and published. All components and dependencies are managed in a simple harmonic “monolith-like” developer experience with smooth control over all changes to your code or your development environment.  

**Scope** - Scopes are next-gen, build-time "microservices” (i.e. “Billing”, “Users” or even “Marketing"). Each scope is made of a set of components required to deliver a feature, and can contain UI elements, data-connected components, widgets, hooks, and even backend modules or anything else required to deliver the service. Different scopes can be owned by different teams, giving each team the power to autonomously develop and deliver innovation.  

Here are few examples of the scopes we build:  

- [Evangelist](https://bit.dev/teambit/evangelist) - Our marketing team scope which is responsible for our marketing site and all marketing related pages and components on Bit.dev. It empowers the marketing team to ship new updates to production autonomously as well as provide services to other teams who can use these components to create better and faster marketing for their products. The marketing team gets to ensure a single and consistent tone and visual language across all experiences and products.  

- [Documenter](https://bit.dev/teambit/documenter)- Our component documentation team’s scope is responsible for the component documentation product on Bit.dev. This scope contains all documentation related components on Bit.dev. It empowers them to ship updates and component documentation services to the rest of our team internally and to the community.  

- [MDX Integration Scope](https://bit.dev/teambit/mdx) - A standalone service extending Bit to support the MDX file format from all ends (UI, modules, extensions, etc.) and acts as a service for other teams to consume and build new services and features on top. Thanks to this Scope you can use MDX to create awesome documentation for your components in Bit.  


### The Bit.dev Platform

The Bit and Bit.dev model is similar to the Git and Github model. Bit is open source and can be used by any team through a self-hosted Bit scope of components. Bit.dev is a platform that helps organizations scale to many scopes and many teams, inter-connecting them into a single collaboration experience with powerful enterprise-grade features for code discoverability, collaboration, security, and team management. It also features Ripple CI, the world's first component-driven CIbuilt for the modern web, which continuously builds changes on the component graph across all teams and projects in the organization.
