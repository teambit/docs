Exporting a component's release version to a remote scope makes it available to be used by other Bit workspaces and non-Bit web projects.

## Export Staged Components

Run the `bit export` command to have Bit export all versioned components. In our case that will be the 'button', 'app-bar', 'use-jokes' and 'tech-jokes-viewer' components.

```bash
bit export
```

Head over to `https://bit.dev/<owner-name>/<scope-name>` to see your exported component, or explore a similar [demo scope](https://bit.dev/demo-org/demo-scope).

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
     <img src="/img/export_scrn_shot.png" width="90%" style={{boxShadow: '3px 3px 15px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.20)'}}></img>
</div>

## Post Export Operations

Once the exporting process completes, the `.bitmap` file gets updated to reflect that new state. Make sure to track it with git.

```bash
git commit -am 'updated .bitmap file after a successful export'
```
